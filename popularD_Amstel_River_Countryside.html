			<h3>The Amstel River’s proud history</h3>
			<p>Amsterdam’s most famous river played a central role in the city’s development. The river was worked into a network of dams and dikes which came to be known as Amsterdam.</p>
			<p>Follow the river through the city past the Hermitage Museum, the beautiful Royal Theatre Carré and the iconic Magere Brug (skinny bridge) and you’re on your way to some of the most beautiful Dutch countryside. Travelling south, whether by bicycle or boat, you will begin to see the river weave and bend. Watch as the buildings fade away, replaced by swaying reeds, green meadows and historic villages.</p>
			<h3>Things to do near the Amstel River Countryside</h3>
			<p>Ouderkerk aan de Amstel is a village that dates back to the 12th century, located on the bank of the Ouderkerkerplas lake. Its ancient monuments, churches and windmills are well worth a visit, as are several exceptional restaurants.</p>
			<p>In the Golden Age, famous artists would retreat to De Ronde Hoep polder to capture its wild nature. And as you continue southbound on or alongside the river, you’ll encounter grand artifacts from the Defence Line of Amsterdam, such as the Fort aan de Drecht, just outside Uithoorn.</p>
			<h3>Travelling to the Amstel River Countryside</h3>
			<p>The ideal way to explore the Amstel River is on the water itself. Hire a boat or take a tour down this beautiful stretch of water to get the best views. You can also ride a bicycle along the well-designed cycle lanes that follow the river, making navigating a breeze.</p>
