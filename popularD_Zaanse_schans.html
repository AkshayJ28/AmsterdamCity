		<p align="center"><i>Located just north of Amsterdam, the Zaanse Schans offers a perfectly preserved glimpse into the Netherlands' industrial past with its traditional houses, windmills, warehouses and workshops. Find out what there is to do and see at the Zaanse Schans!</i></p>

		<p align="left">
			<br><p>In its 18th and 19th century heyday, the Zaan region was an important industrial area dotted by hundreds of windmills producing linseed oil, paint, snuff, mustard, paper and other products. Many of the Zaanse Schans' characteristic village houses are now museums, gift shops or workshops while others are still used as private residences. Some of the Zaanse Schans' remaining windmills are also open to the public.</p>
			<h3>Visiting Zaanse Schans</h3>
			<p>The Zaanse Schans attracts nearly a million visitors per year and it's one of the Netherlands' best loved attractions. The outdoor portion of the Zaanse Schans is open to view without paying admission, but opening times and entrance prices vary at each of its museums, workshops, and windmills.</p> 
			<h3>How to get to Zaanse Schans</h3>
			<p>Many choose to visit the Zaanse Schans as part of a guided tour or excursion, but the village is also easy to reach under your own steam by car or public transport - just catch the train from Amsterdam's Central Station. A 15-minute train ride will take you to Koog-Zaandijk and it's a 10-minute walk from the station. Just look for the windmills!</p>
