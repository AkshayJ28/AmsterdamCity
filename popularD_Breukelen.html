		<p align="center"><i>Breukelen, located north-west of Utrecht, is best known for its nature areas and the large mansions and castle that adorn the banks of the winding Vecht River. Many of these lavish homesteads and their sprawling gardens were constructed in the 17th century by wealthy merchants.</i></p>

			<h3>Elegance from the Dutch Golden Age</h3>
			<p>One such manor is Castle Nyenrode. The castle’s impressive arch, drawbridge and waterway once protected its owner from unwanted house guests and visitors. These features are still effective to this very day. The castle would be destroyed in 1481 and then again in 1511. Since then its ownership has changed hands many times, and it was partially destroyed by a fire in 1673. After World War II, the castle became a Business University institute in 1946. Consequently, It is not open to the public.</p>
			<h3>A town for all seasons</h3>
			<p>Breukelen, the namesake of the New York City borough of Brooklyn, is a great spot for boat tours, bicycle treks, or just an afternoon of sightseeing. One highlight is Boom en Bosch, a quaint park in which you will find the former city hall building. While there head to the garden facing the river Vecht and admire the gorgeous maple trees. There’s also the chance to see a free music performance in the summer months, or sample some delicious Dutch poffertjes (stacks of tiny pancakes with powdered sugar) in the colder parts of the year. Breukelen’s town centre boasts some charming shops, art galleries and restaurants, and there’s a weekly market held on Fridays - ideal for picking up some gifts for friends and family while you’re in the Netherlands.</p>
			<h3>How to get there</h3>
			<p>It’s only a short 30-minute train ride to Breukelen from Amsterdam. The Sprinter services from Amsterdam Centraal to Rotterdam Centraal and Rhenen both stop at Breukelen’s train station. From there you can fully explore the town easily.</p>
			<p>To make the most of your time exploring Amsterdam's surrounding areas, take advantage of the Amsterdam & Region Travel Ticket, which offers unlimited travel on buses, trams, trains and metros in the Amsterdam Area for 24 hours for just €18.50, two days for €26.00, or three for €33.50. </p>
