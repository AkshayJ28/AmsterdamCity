		<p align="center"><i>The fortified town of Muiden sits near the IJmeer, just east of Amsterdam. It dates back to the 10th century and is now known for its peaceful streets, small cafés, historic landmarks and picturesque harbour. The town is a key link in the Defence Line of Amsterdam, a 135 km-long fortification that once protected the city from invaders. Pass through Muiden’s centuries-old walls and prepare for a stroll through one of the country’s oldest communities.</i></p>

			<h3>Amsterdam Castle Muiderslot</h3>
			<p>Muiden combines the best of the past, present and future. One of its main attractions is the medieval Amsterdam Castle Muiderslot. Over the years, it’s been used as a location in various TV shows set in the Middle Ages. It’s a sight to behold. The castle has a drawbridge, five towers, battlements and other features worthy of King Arthur.</p>
			<h3>More Muiden sights and attractions</h3>
			<p>Muiden is a charming town to stroll around, with a lively quayside lined with cafes, with a good view of the boats coming in and out of the harbour. You can also explore more of the town’s historical military defences at the Muizenfort and Westbatterij, both built in the 19th century as part of the Hollandse Waterlinie – the defence line of Holland.
			If you’re looking for an even greater adventure, take the ferry from Muiden to the fortress island of Pampus. This man-made stronghold once helped protect the harbour of Amsterdam. It’s open to the public from April to October.</p>
			<h3>Muiden hotels and restaurants</h3>
			<p>Many of the restaurants in Muiden are concentrated around the picturesque quayside, with waterside terraces that buzz with activity in the warmer months. Popular spots include the charming Brasserie Herengracht, and the nautical themed Graaf Floris V van Muiden. Overnight options are limited in Muiden itself, although the 17th century Hotel-Restaurant het Rechthuis in nearby Muiderberg makes a charming base from which to explore the area. </p>
			<h3>How to get to Muiden from Amsterdam</h3>
			<p>There’s no train station at Muiden, so if you’re travelling by public transport it’s best to get the train to nearby Weesp, which is easily reached from Amsterdam, and then take bus 110 to Muiden ( five minutes. Travel to Muiden is covered by the Amsterdam & Region Travel Ticket.</p>
