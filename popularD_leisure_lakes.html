		<p align="center"><i>For a beautiful day beside or on the water, you needn’t simply take to the seaside: head inland and enjoy the many Leisure Lakes near Amsterdam.</i></p>
		<p align="left">
			<h3>Boating lakes near Amsterdam</h3>
			<p>Connected by rivers, canals and small channels, these picturesque lakes make for a fantastic getaway. Rent a sailing boat, motorboat or even a canoe or windsurfing board to explore, enjoy and relax!</p>
			<h3>Westereinderplassen – the ‘West End’ lakes</h3>
			<p>Experienced boaters will love the opportunity to navigate the network of narrow channels between the tiny islands of the Westereinderplassen. While most of the islands are privately owned, everyone is welcome to moor their boat at the Starteiland (Start Island) – a popular spot for a picnic or barbecue. If you don’t fancy bringing your own supplies, stop off at one of the 50 marinas lining the banks, many of them with restaurants, cafés and sun-drenched terraces.</p>
			<h3>Watersports and speedboating at the Loosdrechte Plassen</h3>
			<p>This recreational area to the south east of Amsterdam is home to five interconnecting lakes known as the Loosdrechtse Plassen. Here you’ll find plenty of opportunities for speedboats and waterskiing, with all sorts of vessels permitted on the open water. The lakes are dotted with islands and picturesque beaches - ideal spots for picnics.</p>
