		<p align="center"><i>Cheese is the first thing that springs to mind when most people think of Edam. This small town, which sits on the bank of the Markermeer, north of Amsterdam, produces a brand of cheese that’s beloved by food fans from around the world.</i></p>
		<p align="left">
			<h3>Edam’s famous history and renowned name</h3>
			<p>Once upon a time, Edam served as a well-trafficked port for cheese and timber traders. Until 1922, the town hosted a market where farmers from miles around sold their wares at a cheese market. Every Wednesday in July and August, this market is recreated complete with cheese carriers, inspectors, farmers and traders. It’s a fascinating glimpse into the past, complete with traditional costumes and music. </p>
			<h3>What to see and do in Edam</h3>
			<p>The Edam Museum, located in a gorgeous house that dates back to the 1540s, offers visitors a journey into the life of a merchant from the Dutch Golden Age. In addition to historical artifacts and paintings, it features only the ‘latest’ in 17th century furnishings.</p>
			<p>Complete the cheese journey with a visit to De Kaaswaag (the cheese weigh house) where you can see a permanent exhibition on the art of making cheese. Taste the different varieties and stock up on dairy-based souvenirs while you’re there.</p>  
			<h3>Sightseeing and architecture</h3>
			<p>Edam’s exquisite architecture and historical atmosphere makes it a fascinating town to stroll through. Marvel at the Speeltoren, an ancient (and slightly lopsided) bell tower that is all that remains of a 14th century church, and step into the Grote Kerk, a magnificent cathedral that dates back to the 15th century. 
			Kwakelbrug is a hand-operated drawbridge and a treasured national monument. Don’t miss a photo opportunity at this iconic spot.</p>
			<h3>How to get to Edam</h3>
			<p>Edam is an easy 35-minute trip from Amsterdam. Bus lines 110, 314 and 316 travel to the pretty town several times an hour. Look out for the buses on the river side of Amsterdam Central Station.
			To make the most of your day exploring, take advantage of the Amsterdam & Region Travel Ticket, which offers unlimited travel on buses, trams, trains and metros in the Amsterdam Area for 24 hours for just € 13.50.</p>
